`Xilem` is a UI toolkit. It combines ideas from `Flutter`, `SwiftUI`, and `Elm`.
Like all of these, it uses lightweight view objects, diffing them to provide
minimal updates to a retained UI. Like `SwiftUI`, it is strongly typed. For more
details on `Xilem`'s reactive architecture see `Xilem`: an [architecture for UI in Rust].

`Xilem`'s reactive layer is built on top of a wide array of foundational Rust UI projects, e.g.:

* Widgets are provided by [Masonry], which is a fork of the now discontinued `Druid` UI toolkit.
* Rendering is provided by [Vello], a high performance GPU compute-centric 2D renderer.
* GPU compute infrastructure is provided by wgpu.
* Text support is provided by [Parley], [Fontique], [swash], and [skrifa].
* Accessibility is provided by [AccessKit].
* Window handling is provided by [winit].

`Xilem` can currently be considered to be in an alpha state. Lots of things need improvements.

### Example
The simplest app looks like this:
```rust
use winit::error::EventLoopError;
use xilem::view::{button, flex, label};
use xilem::{EventLoop, WidgetView, Xilem};

#[derive(Default, Debug)]
struct AppState {
    num: i32,
}

fn app_logic(data: &mut AppState) -> impl WidgetView<AppState> {
    flex((label(format!("{}", data.num)), button("increment", |data: &mut AppState| data.num+=1)))
}

fn main() -> Result<(), EventLoopError> {
    let app = Xilem::new(AppState::default(), app_logic);
    app.run_windowed(EventLoop::with_user_event(), "Counter".into())?;
    Ok(())
}
```
More examples available [here](https://github.com/linebender/xilem/tree/main/xilem/examples).

### View elements
The primitives your `Xilem` appâ€™s view tree will generally be constructed from:
- [`flex`]: layout defines how items will be arranged in rows or columns.
- [`grid`]: layout divides a window into regions and defines the relationship
  between inner elements in terms of size and position.
- [`lens`]: an adapter which allows using a component which only uses one field
  of the current state.
- [`map action`]: provides a message that the parent view has to handle
  to update the state.
- [`adapt`]: the most flexible but also most verbose way to modularize the views
  by state and action.
- [`sized box`]: forces its child to have a specific width and/or height.
- [`button`]: basic button element.
- [`checkbox`]: an element which can be in checked and unchecked state.
- [`image`]: displays the bitmap `image`.
- [`label`]: a non-interactive text element.
- [`portal`]: a view which puts `child` into a scrollable region.
- [`progress bar`]: progress bar element.
- [`prose`]: displays immutable text which can be selected within.
- [`spinner`]: can be used to display that progress is happening on some process.
- [`task`]: launch a task which will run until the view is no longer in the tree.
- [`textbox`]: The textbox widget displays text which can be edited by the user.
- [`variable label`]: displays non-editable text, with a variable [weight].
- [`zstack`]: an element that lays out its children on top of each other.

## Minimum supported Rust Version (MSRV)

This version of Xilem has been verified to compile with **Rust 1.82** and later.

Future versions of Xilem might increase the Rust version requirement.
It will not be treated as a breaking change and as such can even happen with small patch releases.

<details>
<summary>Click here if compiling fails.</summary>

As time has passed, some of Xilem's dependencies could have released versions with a higher Rust requirement.
If you encounter a compilation issue due to a dependency and don't want to upgrade your Rust toolchain, then you could downgrade the dependency.

```sh
# Use the problematic dependency's name and version
cargo update -p package_name --precise 0.1.1
```
